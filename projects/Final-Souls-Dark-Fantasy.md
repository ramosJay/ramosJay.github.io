For our final group assignment, my team members, Karl Penuliar, Ethan Book, and I decided to create an RPG dungeon crawler, similar to the likes of classic Final Fantasy games. The mechanics of the game had the protagonist (player) go through several maps, where he would have random number generated encounters, which trigger a fight. The combat of the game is turn based, and has multiple options while fighting. We also implemented a level up system, where after each fight, the player gains experience points. We also programmed the level-up system for the monsters to scale with the player to make a fair fight. 
We all had various roles in the project, Karl and I worked on  map, sound, and story design. Ethan contributed to the main game engine and art of the characters.
