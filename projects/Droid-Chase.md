summary: My first video game developed for ICS 111. 
<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="/images/1Games.png">

The objective of this game is to control the character using a keypad, and collect the items in the map within the given time. Then output the score. I went a step further and added lives and enemies to the map. I was inspired by one of my favorite game series, Super Mario.
