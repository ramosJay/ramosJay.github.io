## Same-Same, but Different

With only knowing Java and some C++, Javascript was like learning a new, yet familiar, language. Words and phrases are common in both languages, but they can be used differently with or without restrictions. I was never familiar with Javascript, nor did I know what it was exactly. I only knew it was related to website building and my only experience with that was with customizing my Myspace page in middle school. However, learning a new language is always exciting. At first, I was a little confused,  but after taking it slow and redoing some of the modules over and over again, it started to stick. Then I saw how useful it became, and opened up more possibilities in designing my own websites without paying a third-party app or company to do it for you. This past week was my first introduction to Javascript, and I have to say, I am liking it a lot.

## Race Against the Clock

In honesty, athletic software engineering like the WODs are definitely stress inducing, yet also exciting at the same time. At the point of writing this essay, we only had our practice WODs and I definitely struggled a bit. I definitely facepalmed myself several times after realizing how simple the assignment actually was. You want to make sure your code works and that you finish in time, which to some people, like myself, can be very intimidating. However, I understand the point of these WODs, as they are preparing us for real life scenarios in the field of software development. Big tech companies want programmers that can think on their feet and adapt to any given obstacle either with Java, C, or Javascript.

## Practice Makes Perfect

In retrospect, I see Javascript as another versatile skill in the software engineer’s arsonal. But it takes time and practice to learn a new coding language. It also depends how often you use it on a daily basis, like a forign speaking language, you tend to forget the more you don’t use it. What really helped me was the ability of using sites like freecodecamp and other free online sources to hone my skill as a software engineer. Having the ability to redo the entire basics and ES6 over again, is a big help, especially wanting Javascript to become second nature.
